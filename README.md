# cards_probabiltiy
this is a code I did for fun to evaluate the hands types dealt for a huge amount of time. gives a feedback of number of occurrence and probability of each type of hand.


it creates a deck of cards, shuffle it, deal a hand of 7 cards and evaluate the type of hands occured each time and increment it to an array that hold the number of occurance in each hand. then in the end gives a representation of the number of types this pairs occurs and what is the probability of it occurring.
